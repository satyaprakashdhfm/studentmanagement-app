# Student Management System - Business Logic Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to test and verify the comprehensive business logic implemented in the student management database.

## üöÄ Quick Test Run

```bash
# 1. Connect to your database
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d student_management

# 2. Run the setup script (if not already done)
\i database/setup.sql

# 3. Run the business logic tests
\i database/test_business_logic.sql
```

## üìã Business Logic Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ 1. Student Creation Automation
**What it does:** Automatically creates fee records for all fee types when a student is added.

**Test it:**
```sql
-- Add a new student
INSERT INTO students (student_id, name, email, class_id, status)
VALUES ('TEST001', 'John Doe', 'john@example.com', 242508001, 'active');

-- Check if fees were auto-created
SELECT * FROM fees WHERE student_id = 'TEST001';
```

### ‚úÖ 2. Schedule Conflict Prevention
**What it does:** Prevents teachers from being double-booked at the same time.

**Test it:**
```sql
-- Try to schedule the same teacher twice at the same time
INSERT INTO class_schedule (schedule_id, class_id, day_of_week, slot_id, academic_year, teacher_id)
VALUES ('SCH001', 242508001, 1, 'P1_0900_0940', '2024-2025', 'T001');

INSERT INTO class_schedule (schedule_id, class_id, day_of_week, slot_id, academic_year, teacher_id)
VALUES ('SCH002', 242508002, 1, 'P1_0900_0940', '2024-2025', 'T001');
-- This should fail with conflict error
```

### ‚úÖ 3. Teacher Qualification Validation
**What it does:** Ensures teachers can only teach subjects they're qualified for.

**Test it:**
```sql
-- Try to assign unqualified teacher
INSERT INTO class_schedule (schedule_id, class_id, day_of_week, slot_id, academic_year, teacher_id, subject_code)
VALUES ('SCH003', 242508001, 2, 'P2_0940_1020', '2024-2025', 'T001', 'INVALID_SUBJECT');
-- This should fail with qualification error
```

### ‚úÖ 4. Automated Grade Calculation
**What it does:** Auto-calculates grades based on marks percentage.

**Test it:**
```sql
-- Add marks (should auto-calculate grade)
INSERT INTO marks (marks_id, student_id, class_id, examination_type, marks_obtained, max_marks, entry_date, subject_code)
VALUES ('M001', 'S001', 242508001, 'small_test', 95, 100, CURRENT_DATE, 'MATH_8');

-- Check the auto-calculated grade
SELECT grade FROM marks WHERE marks_id = 'M001'; -- Should be 'A+'
```

### ‚úÖ 5. Fee Payment Validation
**What it does:** Prevents over-payment and auto-calculates balance.

**Test it:**
```sql
-- Add fee payment
INSERT INTO fees (fee_id, student_id, class_id, fee_type, amount_due, amount_paid, academic_year)
VALUES ('F001', 'S001', 242508001, 'tuition_term1', 1000.00, 600.00, '2024-2025');

-- Check auto-calculated balance
SELECT balance FROM fees WHERE fee_id = 'F001'; -- Should be 400.00
```

### ‚úÖ 7. User Account Auto-Creation
**What it does:** Automatically creates user accounts when students or teachers are added.

**Test it:**
```sql
-- Add a new student (user account auto-created)
INSERT INTO students (student_id, name, email, class_id, status)
VALUES ('S001', 'John Doe', 'john@example.com', 242508001, 'active');

-- Check if user account was created
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'S001'; -- Should show student account

-- Add a new teacher (user account auto-created)
INSERT INTO teachers (teacher_id, name, email, subjects_handled, active)
VALUES ('T001', 'Jane Smith', 'jane@example.com', ARRAY['MATH_8'], TRUE);

-- Check if user account was created
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'T001'; -- Should show teacher account
```

**Features:**
- Username = student_id/teacher_id
- Default password format: `DefaultPass + Last4DigitsOfID + CurrentYear`
- Proper role assignment (student/teacher)
- Name parsing for first_name/last_name
- Email from student/teacher record

## üîß Useful Functions Available

### Get Available Teachers
```sql
-- Get teachers available for a specific class, subject, day, and slot
SELECT * FROM get_available_teachers_for_class(
    242508001,     -- class_id
    'MATH_8',      -- subject_code
    1,             -- day_of_week (optional)
    'P1_0900_0940' -- slot_id (optional)
);
```

### Class Utilization Report
```sql
-- Get utilization report for all classes or specific class
SELECT * FROM get_class_utilization();           -- All classes
SELECT * FROM get_class_utilization(242508001);  -- Specific class
```

### Generate Schedule ID
```sql
-- Generate meaningful schedule ID
SELECT generate_schedule_id(242508001, 1, 'P1_0900_0940', 'MATH_8');
-- Returns: '1_1_242508001_MATH_8'
```

## üìä Monitoring Queries

### Check All Triggers
```sql
SELECT trigger_name, event_object_table, event_manipulation, action_timing
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE trigger_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY event_object_table;
```

### Check All Functions
```sql
SELECT routine_name, data_type as return_type
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' AND routine_type = 'FUNCTION';
```

### Check All Constraints

SELECT table_name, constraint_name, constraint_type
FROM information_schema.table_constraints
WHERE table_schema = 'public';
```

## üßπ Cleanup

After testing, clean up test data:
```sql
DELETE FROM fees WHERE student_id LIKE 'TEST_%';
DELETE FROM students WHERE student_id LIKE 'TEST_%';
DELETE FROM marks WHERE marks_id LIKE 'TEST_%';
DELETE FROM class_schedule WHERE schedule_id LIKE 'TEST_%';
```
